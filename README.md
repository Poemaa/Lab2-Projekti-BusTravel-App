# Lab2-Projekti-BusTravel-App

This Bus Travel app was a project that I took part of during university. The Bus Travel App is made to simplify getting around and traveling in my country and can be used by local people or also tourists. 
It's a platform for mainly dedicated to bus schedules, with detailed access for bus routes and their timetables across Kosovo. The app also provides real-time weather updates for various countries
and you can log in effortlessly via your Google account. It also includes a recommendation page with all the best cafes, restaurants and attractions to visit in many cities in Kosova for an enriched
travel experience.

To run the project, you need to run both the front end and the back end, so they can communicate with each other. They are divided into to folders, one containing all the necessary parts of contains the
backend of the app, built using ASP .NET CORE 7 and the other is the Front-End folder, which corresponds to the code for the frontend part of the app which was built with React.js
